#### An exercise in integrating the Google Maps Street View API with tracking.js in a MEAN-stack webApp

The website currently allows users to navigate left and right, and move forward in Google Street View using only the position of their face relative to the detecting camera.

Future updates will:
  * Beautify the website, using AngularJS
  * Allow users to access a 'random' Street View from a database list
  * Allow users to save their trips, and curate their own favorite places to visit using Mongoose and MongoDB
  * Add a speed dial to the Street View view, so that users can toggle their speed accordingly with respect to location (ex. museum versus an interstate, where one may wish to travel slower or faster)
